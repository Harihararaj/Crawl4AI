For contributions less than $250, if a receipt has not been provided, a cancelled check or a bank record will suffice. You cannot deduct casual donations that you drop into a charity's collection box or bucket without a receipt. If you receive some goods or services in exchange for your donation, the charity must specify the value of those goods or services. You can only deduct the amount of your donation that is above that value. The paperwork from the charitable organization should spell out what is deductible.",
