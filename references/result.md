###  Great Tips 
## Greatways Tax Service Inc. Great Service @ Right Ways, Since 2002. (ISO 9001-2015 Certified)
### 2018 Tax Law Changes For Individuals
The new Tax Act reduces tax rates for individuals and corporations, repeals exemptions, eliminates many deductions, and increases the Standard Deduction to a level which eliminates Itemized deductions for most taxpayers.
Most of the individual changes will expire at the end of 2025, meaning the old tax code rates and deductions will return in 2026 unless Congress passes another law before then.
**Taxpayers are required to provide the Social Security Number of each dependent to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit.**
Following are the most notable changes taking effect after December 31, 2017
Tax Rates: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%. 
Personal Exemptions: The personal exemption is repealed.
Standard Deduction: Single taxpayers and married taxpayers who file separate returns can claim a $12,000 standard deduction. Married couples filing jointly can claim $24,000, and taxpayers filing as "head of household" (single individuals with dependents) can claim a standard deduction of $18,000
Affordable Care Act: The requirement to maintain Minimum Affordable Coverage is suspended after 2018
Alimony: For divorces after 2018 alimony payments to a former spouse are neither taxable to the recipient spouse nor deductible by the payer spouse
Casualty Losses: Deductions for unexpected losses to personal property are no longer deductible unless covered by specific Presidentially Declared Federal Disaster Declarations
Child tax Credit: The child tax credit will increase to $2,000 per qualifying child and will be refundable up to $1,400, subject to phase out limitations.
**Taxpayers are required to provide the Social Security Number of each dependent to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit.**
Additionally, a new $500 nonrefundable credit for other qualifying dependents who are not qualifying children has been enacted. Phase outs which are not indexed for inflation, will begin with adjusted gross income of more than $400,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and more than $200,000 for all other taxpayers
College Credits: The American Opportunity credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit remain unchanged.
Individual retirement Accounts: **Roth IRA Conversions may no longer be recharacterized.** Other types of IRA recharacterization are unaffected. A contribution to a Roth IRA may be recharacterized to a Traditional IRA before the due date of the tax return but a conversion to a Roth IRA may not be reversed.
Moving Expense Reimbursements Moving expense reimbursements **_are no longer excludable_** from Wages or Gross Income with Military exemption 
Mortgage Interest: Home Mortgage Interest is capped at $750,000 of Acquisition Indebtedness. The current Home Mortgage Interest Deduction to the extent of $1,000,000 of Mortgage Interest is Grandfathered. ** _Home Equity Mortgage Interest is no longer deductible_**** _Deductions are capped at** _$10,000 for State, Local, Real Estate, Personal property Taxes, and Sales Taxes_**_**
These are the few importance changes may affect most of you and there are so many more changes from last year to this year and we will make sure you will get the maximum advantage from the new tax law changes during the tax preparation
**One most important thing: If any one is eligible for Social Security for their dependent please apply asap. Taxpayers are required to provide the Social Security Number of each dependent to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit. ITIN is not eligible for child tax credit.**

###  Great Tips 
## Greatways Tax Service Inc. Great Service @ Right Ways, Since 2002. (ISO 9001-2015 Certified)
### 2018 Tax Law Changes for Business
**_Alternative Minimum Tax:_** Effective for tax years beginning after 2017, corporations are no longer subject to AMT.
**_Bonus Depreciation_** : Additional First Year Depreciation is available to new and used property. The requirement that the first qualified use begins with the taxpayer is repealed.
**_Corporate Tax Rates_** : The Corporate Tax rate for **_C Corp is reduced to 21%_** beginning January 1, 2018 and is permanent
**_Depreciation_** : Automobile Business Use depreciation limits have been increased and indexed for inflation. For vehicles placed into service after 2017 the new limits for vehicles not claiming Bonus Depreciation are as follows: 1st Year: $10,000 2nd Year: $16,000 3rd Year: 9,600 4th Year and After: $5,760
**_Pass-through Entities_** : Non-corporate taxpayers, including trusts or estates, who have **_domestic qualified business income_** (QBI) from a partnership, **_S corporation_** , or sole proprietorship are allowed to _deduct 20% of business-related income_ , subject to certain wage limits and exceptions. The remaining income is subject to normal individual rates.
The 20% deduction is not allowed in computing adjusted gross income (AGI), but rather is allowed as a deduction reducing taxable income. It does not reduce income subject to SE tax. The deduction is also not allowed for businesses offering certain personal services.
The deduction ratably phases out for joint filers with income between $315,000 and $415,000 and between $157,500 and $207,500 for others.
This provision provides an alternate limitation based on wages and capital. The limitation is the greater of 50% of the wages paid or 25% of the wages paid plus 2.5% of the unadjusted basis of the business' capital assets.

### Can I make contributions to both a SEP and a Solo 401(k) Plan?
Yes. You can make contributions to both a SEP and a Solo 401K Plan. In other words, a business can have both a SEP IRA and a Solo 401(K) Plan, although, there is generally no advantage for a business to have both active at the same time. A Solo 401(k) Plan includes both an employee and profit sharing contribution option, whereas, a SEP IRA is purely a profit sharing plan.
Under the 2015 Solo 401(k) contribution rules, a plan participant under the age of 50 can make a maximum employee deferral contribution in the amount of $18,000. That amount can be made in pre-tax or after-tax (Roth).
On the profit sharing side, the business can make a 25% (20% in the case of a sole proprietorship or single member LLC) profit sharing contribution up to a combined maximum, including the employee deferral, of $53,000, an increase of $1,000 from 2014.
For plan participants over the age of 50, an individual can make a maximum employee deferral contribution in the amount of $24,000. That amount can be made in pre-tax or after-tax (Roth).
On the profit sharing side, the business can make a 25% (20% in the case of a sole proprietorship or single member LLC) profit sharing contribution up to a combined maximum, including the employee deferral, of $59,000, an increase of $1,500 from 2014.
In other words, having both a SEP IRA and a Solo 401(k) Plan will not allow a business owner to defer more than $53,000 ($59,000 if the individual is over the age of 50) for 2015.
Most individuals will use a Solo 401(k) Plan vs. a SEP IRA since you can reach the maximum annual contribution limit quicker than a SEP IRA since the Solo 401(k) Plan includes both an employee deferral and profit sharing component, whereas, a SEP IRA just includes just a profit sharing component.
If you are looking for more tax advantage with less contribution, I would recomend SEP IRA.
If you need any more information regarding the above topic, contact me at 630-663-1500.

  * Out-of-state returns
  * Prior year returns
  * Amendments to returns


Q: What documents do I need to send or bring with the tax questionnaire?

  * If you paid for childcare, documentation listing the provider's name, address, tax ID number, and amount paid

  * Medical bills paid (total)
  * Charitable contributions/donations made during the year
  * Any other tax-related documents you have received
  * Any document or letter you received from the IRS or state
  * Both taxpayers/spouses must sign the return


Q: What information do I need to claim a dependent care benefit?
A: You will need to provide the following information:
  * Name of the provider
  * SSN or EIN of the provider
  * Address of the provider
  * Amount you paid to the provider


Q: What expenses are included in the dependent care benefit?
A: The following expenses are included in the dependent care benefit:
  * Before-school and after-school care
  * Preschool/nursery school expenses
  * Extended day programs
  * Babysitter expenses (in or out of the home)
  * Nanny services (amounts paid for the actual care of the dependent)
  * Summer day camp for qualifying children under the age of 13


Q: My spouse is not working. Can I claim the dependent care benefit?
A: No, in order to receive the dependent care benefit, both taxpayers/spouses must be employed, a full-time student, or disabled.
Q: What documentation is required for deductions for charitable contributions?
A: To claim a deduction for cash, check, or other monetary gift, you must have a written confirmation from the charity that contains the following information:
  * Name of the organization
  * Date of the contribution
  * Amount of the contribution


Charities are only required to provide written acknowledgement for donations over $250, but most charitable organizations provide some sort of receipt no matter what size of donation you provide. For contributions less than $250, if a receipt has not been provided, a cancelled check or a bank record will suffice. You cannot deduct casual donations that you drop into a charity's collection box or bucket without a receipt. If you receive some goods or services in exchange for your donation, the charity must specify the value of those goods or services. You can only deduct the amount of your donation that is above that value. The paperwork from the charitable organization should spell out what is deductible.
Q: Can I take a deduction for my volunteer work?
A: No, you cannot deduct the value of your time spent on charitable work as a charitable donation, but you can deduct your out-of-pocket costs such as mileage, currently set at 14 cents per mile.
Q: What do I need to receive the college credit?
A: You will need a Form 1098-T from the college with the amount of tuition paid.
Q: Do I have to come into the office to apply?
A: No, if you cannot come into the office, i.e., you live out of state, you may use our drop-off service through our client portal.
Q: Do I need to file income tax if I worked in the U.S. for a month and then returned to my home country?
A: It depends on the amount of income, but we would recommend to file the tax return as long as you have some income from the U.S
Q: When should I apply?
A: You can file a tax return as soon as you have all the necessary documents, such as your W-2 forms and 1099s. However, the IRS recommends waiting until you have received your W-2 from your employer, even if it is not due until February 14th. This is because your W-2 will contain the most accurate information about your income and taxes withheld.
Q: Can I pay the tax preparation fee by credit card?
A: Yes, you can pay the tax preparation fee by credit card if you come into the office in person. However, if you are filing your taxes remotely, we only accept payment from your checking account as an ACH debit.
Q: Can I file the tax return using the information from my last paystub of the year?
A: The IRS recommends that you wait for your W-2 from your employer before filing your tax return. Your W-2 will contain the most accurate information about your income and taxes withheld. Your last paystub may not reflect exactly what you earned for the entire year, and it may not include all of the information that the IRS needs to process your tax return.
Q: If I have any more questions, can I contact you?
A: Yes, you are always welcome to contact us by email or phone. Our preferred way of communication is email.

###  Frequently Asked Questions 
## Greatways Tax Service Inc. Great Service @ Right Ways, Since 2002. (ISO 9001-2015 Certified)
## FAQ on Sales Tax Service
**Q: What is nexus?**
A: Nexus, also known as sufficient physical presence, is the determining factor of whether an out-of-state business selling products into a state is liable for collecting the tax on sales in the state. Nexus is created if your company maintains a temporary or permanent presence of people (employees, service people or independent sales/service agents) or property (inventory, offices, warehouses). The temporary presence is created through traveling people visiting states to call on customers or prospects, trade show attendance, or consigned inventory in warehouses. Nexus is created once a substantial physical presence is established. Unfortunately, this is not clearly defined by each state and can vary from 1 day to a number of days in other states. Nexus means a business entity has established a direct or representational presence within a particular state or jurisdiction. This presence gives the state the right to require a company to pay or collect and remit certain taxes.
**Q: How do I know if I should be collecting tax in a state?**
A: You are responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax to a jurisdiction if you have established substantial presence in the state of delivery. Once established, you have created nexus. The threshold for this presence differs from state to state and a company's presence in each state should be examined to determine if nexus has been established or not. A company clearly has nexus if there is a business location or there are employees living in or working in the state/jurisdiction. Once you establish nexus, you are required to register as a retailer with each state before collecting sales tax for that state.
**Q: When making a sale, do you collect tax for the state that you are located in or the state where the customer is located?**
A: You collect the tax for the state where the property is delivered to your customer. If the item is shipped to the customer, then tax applies for the delivery state. You should collect the tax only if you are registered to collect tax in that state. If the customer picks up the item at your location, tax should be collected for your state.
**Q: What is a resale certificate and who can use one?**
A: Resale certificates are used by purchasers, when acquiring property for resale in its present form or as components of other property. They are also used to purchase taxable services that become a part of property for resale in some states. States that allow for resale exemptions either accept a state issued resale certificate or, in some cases, a multi-state certificate. A business which is registered for sales and use tax can use a resale certificate only when the merchandise being purchased is to be resold by the business. A business cannot use a resale certificate to purchase merchandise that they will use and consume in the conduct of business. Any merchandise obtained upon resale certificate is subject to sales and use tax if it is used or consumed by the purchaser in any manner, and must be reported and the tax paid thereon direct to the appropriate jurisdiction.
**Q: Why doesn't the out-of-state retailer collect the tax?**
A: If the retailer is located out-of-state and does not have a physical location or other type of physical representation in the state, the state cannot require the retailer to collect their sales tax. However, some out-of-state retailers voluntarily collect the tax as a convenience to their customers. If the retailer does not collect the sales tax, the purchaser has the obligation to pay the use tax directly to the state where the property is used as long as the item is taxable.
**Q: Is a sales tax return required even if my sales equal zero?**
A: Yes. Every business with a sales tax license is required to file a return even though no sales were made during the period covered by the return. However, if you have seasonal sales or your sales tax liability has declined, you may request less frequent filing from the state.
**Q: How do I send my sales record to you?**
A: We will need you to complete our Monthly Sales Record which can be found in our website under Forms and email the completed forms to us at payroll@greatwaysinc.com.
**Q: How much does the sale tax service cost?**
A: Our sale tax service starts at $100.00 a month, which includes one retail location.
**Q: If I have any more questions can I contact you?**
A: You are always welcome to contact us by email payroll@greatwaysinc.com or by phone 630-663-1500 x 2 For Sale Tax Service and x 1 for Pramod Zacharias. Our preferred way of communication is Email.

### How Will the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Impact Me
_How Will the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Impact Me_
**_Standard deduction_** : the standard deduction will be nearly doubled. Rises to $24,000 from this year's $13,000 for marrieds filing jointly and it climbs to $12,000 for singles.
**_Mortgage interest deduction_** : going forward, the deduction will be limited to interest on the first $750,000 you borrow. That's down from the current rule, which lPets you deduct interest on the first $1 million of debt.
**_Tax rates and brackets_** : the bill retains the current seven brackets. But rates and income levels to which they apply will change.
**_Pass-through business income_** : taxes on partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships will be calculated by exempting 20% of all net business taxable income that the business earns, with limits.
**_Recharacterization of a Roth IRA conversion_** : The bill kills the ability to do a recharacterization for tax years after Dec. 31.
**_State and local taxes_** : an individual's itemized deduction for state income taxes and local property taxes will be capped at a total of $10,000.
**_Child tax credit_** expanded and will be allowed at higher levels of income (phasing out beginning at $400,000 of income in place of $110,000)

### Itemizing the tax return V/s Standard Deduction
There are two Great Ways to deduct your expense on your federal tax return. Based on the new tax law, the easy and simple way is standard deduction. If you are single you can deduct $12,000. if married you can deduct $24,000 if head if the household you can deduct $18,000
There is a limit of $10,000 for the State, Local and Real Estate tax to deduct on the Schedule A (the total of State, Local and Real Estate tax is sealed to $10,000)
For example, if you are single and own a home with mortgage of $300,000 @ 4% interest should itemize. Mortgage interest on the home itself is $12,000 and when we add the state and real estate tax (Maximum we can claim is $10,000) the total itemized deduction is $22,000 plus other deductions such as Donations, Medical Expense etc.
Qualified Medical Expense have a Floor of 10% for adjusted Gross income (starting from 2019) and your Adjusted Gross income is $75,000, first 7500 is a floor and any thing above will add to the standard deduction.
No Double benefit allowed: If you paid the medical expense by your Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible spending Arrangements you can’t claim the same expense on Schedule A.

### Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) between US and India
Both US and India, signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to promote transparency on tax matters. Come September 30, 2015 India and the US will start sharing information about bank accounts or financial investments made by their citizens in each other's countries. This move will help curb offshore tax evasions. "This will bring in greater transparency in tax administration and enforcing tax compliance as well as prevention of offshore tax evasion. This is a major step in the Government's resolve to fight the menace of black money," Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das said after signing the agreement on behalf of India. US Ambassador to India Richard Verma was another signatory. The US enacted FATCA in 2010 to obtain information on accounts held by its taxpayers in other countries. It allows US financial institutions to withhold a portion of payments made to foreign financial institutions (FFIs) who do not agree to identify and report information on US account-holders. Not only the Interest on the NRE account but also the interest from any other account such as NRO or any other income from anywhere in the world need to be report on the US Income tax return. You may able to claim the tax you paid in foreign county as foreign tax credit on US income tax return. If you didn't report any income in the past, we would recommend to amend the tax return and pay the tax for the understated income ASAP. If you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment please feel free to contact us at 630-663-1500 or you can email us at tax@greatwaysinc.com.

###  Great Tips 
## Greatways Tax Service Inc. Great Service @ Right Ways, Since 2002. (ISO 9001-2015 Certified)
### Canceled or Forgiven Debt
As a general rule, debt that is canceled or forgiven by an official lender is considered taxable income. For example, if you settle a credit card debt for less than the full balance, you will owe income tax on the amount that was forgiven. This extra income can increase tax bracket, Child tax credit. Earned Income Credit etc can be lower or eliminate. So please consider the tax implications before you make a decision to negotiate with lender. In short, if you received a 1099 C from a lender, don't discard it, bring it to the Accountant at the time of income tax preparation. 1099 C need to report on the tax return.
###  Exceptions
Debts discharged in bankruptcy
If you filed for bankruptcy protection, do not report the canceled debt as income. A debt discharged in bankruptcy has no income tax consequences to an individual debtor, as it is excluded from a debtor's gross income pursuant to Internal Revenue Code ï¿½108(a)(1)(A).
Forgiven interest on Business Debt
Forgiven interest on business debt is not considered as income if your business follow the cash basis accounting. You do not have to pay tax on the portion of the debt due to interest, if you could have deducted the interest if you had paid it. On the other hand, if you could not have deducted it. for example, if it was interest on a personal credit card, you must pay taxes on all the forgiven debt, including the interest.
If you need any more information regarding the above topic, contact me at 630-663-1500.

You will be considered covered if you are insured through an employer, an insurance plan bought on your own, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, COBRA, retiree coverage, TRICARE, or VA health coverage. On the Marketplace website when you complete an application you will find out what you qualify for including private insurance plans, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Marketplace will tell you if you qualify for lower costs based on your household size and income. Plans cover essential health benefits, pre-existing conditions, and preventive care. If you do not qualify for lower prices you can still buy insurance at the standard price on the Marketplace website. If you qualify for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Marketplace will share that information with your state agency, many states are expanding Medicaid to cover more people in 2014. If you are eligible for insurance through an employer you have the option to switch to a marketplace plan, however you will not qualify for lower costs based on your income unless the job-based insurance is not affordable or does not meet the minimum requirements. The IRS will be administering the tax provisions. There is a premium tax credit that may help make the cost of purchasing health insurance coverage. In January of 2014, you must either have health care coverage, have an exemption from coverage, or make a payment when you file your 2014 tax return in 2015. If you do not have health insurance in 2014 you will pay a penalty of $95.00 per adult, $47.50 per child, or 1% of your income (whichever is greater). This fee is called the Individual Shared responsibility payment and these fees will increase every year, these fees will be due when you make your tax payment. You may qualify for an exemption from paying the fee, there is a list on the Marketplace website, some of them include: if you were uninsured for less than 3 months of the year, the lowest-priced coverage available to you would cost more than 8% of your household income, you don't file a tax return because your income is too low and different types of hardships that may have affected your ability to purchase an insurance plan. You can apply for an exemption on the Marketplace website or when you file your 2014 federal tax return. If you get insurance through the Marketplace you may be able to claim a premium tax credit, which you can have advance payments sent directly to your insurer during 2014 or you can claim them when you file your tax returns. If you choose payments in advance you will have to reconcile the payments on your 2014 tax return. If you are a business owner, depending on the size of your business will determine if you are eligible for tax credits, health care options, and your responsibilities as a business owner. If you have less than 25 full-time equivalent employees may be eligible for a Small Business Tax Credit to help cover the cost of providing coverage. If you have less than 50 employees you might be eligible to buy coverage through the Small Business Health Options Program. If you have 50 or more employees an annual return will need to be completed to state what insurance was offered their employees and they may also be subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provisions.
