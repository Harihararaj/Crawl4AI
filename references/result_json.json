      "Canceled or Forgiven Debt": "As a general rule, debt that is canceled or forgiven by an official lender is considered taxable income. For example, if you settle a credit card debt for less than the full balance, you will owe income tax on the amount that was forgiven. This extra income can increase tax bracket, Child tax credit. Earned Income Credit etc can be lower or eliminate. So please consider the tax implications before you make a decision to negotiate with lender. In short, if you received a 1099 C from a lender, don't discard it, bring it to the Accountant at the time of income tax preparation. 1099 C need to report on the tax return.",
